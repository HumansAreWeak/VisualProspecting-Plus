# GregTech 6 Add-On: VisualProspecting Plus

A fork of [Visual Prospecting](https://github.com/SinTh0r4s/VisualProspecting) by SinTh0r4s.
The addition of the Plus in the title means, that it tries to incorporate GT6 API for the backend to track the ore veins.

It is under heavy development and not at all usable right now.
